Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, and fellow teck enthusiasts;

Today, I'm honored to discuss a game changing technology that's reshaping industries and human potential; Artificial Intelligence. As the Director of IT at Safaricom, I'm excited to share our journey in harnessing AI's transformative power.

AI's impact spans sectors like healthcare, finance, and entertainment, revolutionizing how we approach challenges.

Our dedicated team at Safaricom is at the forefront of developing AI solutions that amplify business capabilities and enhance everyday lives.

AI's essence lies in its adaptability and learning capacity, which enable us to extract valuable insights from vast datasets.

However, we must be mindful of the ethical considerations surrounding AI, addressing issues like bias, privacy, and the evolving job market.

Our commitment extends beyond technological advancements; we're dedicated to leveraging AI for positive societal impact.

Through partnerships and collaborations, we're working to ensure that the benefits of AI are accessible globally, bridging gaps and fostering inclusivity.

Education plays a crucial role in this journey, as we strive to equip individuals with the skills needed to thrive in an AI-driven world.

Let's remember, AI is a tool to enhance human potential, expanding our abilities rather than replacing us.

Join us in shaping an AI-powered future that prioritizes innovation, responsibility, and collaboration.

Thank you.
